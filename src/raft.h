 * #NULL.
 *
 * An entry that was received from the network as part of an AppendEntries RPC
 * or that was loaded from disk at startup should normally have a @batch
 * attribute that points to a contiguous chunk of memory that contains the data
 * of the entry itself plus possibly the data for other entries that were
 * received or loaded with it at the same time. In this case the @buf pointer
 * will be equal to the @batch pointer plus an offset, that locates the position
 * of the entry's data within the batch.
 *
 * When the @batch attribute is not #NULL the raft library will take care of
 * releasing that memory only once there are no more references to the
 * associated entries.
 *
 * This arrangement makes it possible to minimize the amount of memory-copying
 * when performing I/O.
 *
 * The @is_local field is set to `true` by a leader that appends an entry to its

 * via AppendEntries to its volatile log. It is not represented in the AppendEntries
 * message or in the persistent log. This field can be used by the FSM's `apply`
 * callback to handle a COMMAND entry differently depending on whether it
 * originated locally.

 * Note: The @local_data and @is_local fields do not exist when we use an external
 * libraft, because the last separate release of libraft predates their addition.
 * The ifdef at the very top of this file ensures that we use the system raft headers
 * when we build against an external libraft, so there will be no ABI mismatch as

	 * #configuration and #configuration_last_snapshot must be empty and
	 * have no servers.
	 *
	 * 2. #configuration_committed_index is non-zero and
	 *    #configuration_uncommitted_index is zero. This means that
	 *    #configuration is committed and there is no pending configuration
	 *    change. The content of #configuration must match the one of the
	 * log entry at #configuration_committed_index.
	 *
	 * 3. #configuration_committed_index and
	 * #configuration_uncommitted_index are both non-zero, with the latter
	 * being greater than the former. This means that #configuration is
	 * uncommitted and represents a pending configuration change. The
	 * content of #configuration must match the one of the log entry at
	 * #configuration_uncommitted_index.
	 *
	 * When a snapshot is taken, a copy of the most recent configuration
	 * known to be committed (i.e. the configuration contained in the log
	 * entry at #configuration_committed_index) is saved in
	 * #configuration_last_snapshot, so it can be easily retrieved in case
	 * the log gets truncated because of compaction and does not contain the
	 * entry at #configuration_committed_index anymore. Likewise, if a
	 * snapshot is restored its associated configuration is saved in

 * The implementation of metadata and log persistency is virtually the same as

 *
 * The disk files consist of metadata files, closed segments, and open
 * segments. Metadata files are used to track Raft metadata, such as the
 * server's current term, vote, and log's start index. Segments contain
 * contiguous entries that are part of the log. Closed segments are never
 * written to again (but may be renamed and truncated if a suffix of the log is
 * truncated). Open segments are where newly appended entries go. Once an open
 * segment reaches the maximum allowed size, it is closed and a new one is used.
 *
 * Metadata files are named "metadata1" and "metadata2". The code alternates
 * between these so that there is always at least one readable metadata file.
 * On boot, the readable metadata file with the higher version number is used.
 *
 * The format of a metadata file is:
 *
 * [8 bytes] Format (currently 1).
 * [8 bytes] Incremental version number.
 * [8 bytes] Current term.
 * [8 bytes] ID of server we voted for.
 *
 * Closed segments are named by the format string "%lu-%lu" with their
 * start and end indexes, both inclusive. Closed segments always contain at
 * least one entry; the end index is always at least as large as the start
 * index. Closed segment files may occasionally include data past their
 * filename's end index (these are ignored but a warning is logged). This can
 * happen if the suffix of the segment is truncated and a crash occurs at an
 * inopportune time (the segment file is first renamed, then truncated, and a
 * crash occurs in between).
 *
 * Open segments are named by the format string "open-%lu" with a unique
 * number. These should not exist when the server shuts down cleanly, but they
 * exist while the server is running and may be left around during a crash.
 * Open segments either contain entries which come after the last closed
 * segment or are full of zeros. When the server crashes while appending to an
 * open segment, the end of that file may be corrupt. We can't distinguish
 * between a corrupt file and a partially written entry. The code assumes it's
 * a partially written entry, logs a warning, and ignores it.
 *
 * Truncating a suffix of the log will remove all entries that are no longer
 * part of the log. Truncating a prefix of the log will only remove complete
 * segments that are before the new log start index. For example, if a
 * segment has entries 10 through 20 and the prefix of the log is truncated to
 * start at entry 15, that entire segment will be retained.
 *
 * Each segment file starts with a segment header, which currently contains
 * just an 8-byte version number for the format of that segment. The current
 * format (version 1) is just a concatenation of serialized entry batches.
 *
 * Each batch has the following format:
 *
 * [4 bytes] CRC32 checksum of the batch header, little endian.
 * [4 bytes] CRC32 checksum of the batch data, little endian.
 * [  ...  ] Batch (as described in @raft_decode_entries_batch).

 *
 * In particular, the following happens:
 *
 * 1. If there are pending #raft_io_send requests, that have been submitted
 *    using #raft_io->send() and not yet sent, the oldest one is picked and the
 *    relevant callback fired. This simulates completion of a socket write,
 *    which means that the send request has been completed. The receiver does
 *    not immediately receives the message, as the message is propagating
 *    through the network. However any memory associated with the #raft_io_send
 *    request can be released (e.g. log entries). The in-memory I/O
 *    implementation assigns a latency to each RPC message, which will get
 *    delivered to the receiver only after that amount of time elapses. If the
 *    sender and the receiver are currently disconnected, the RPC message is
 *    simply dropped. If a callback was fired, jump directly to 3. and skip 2.
 *
 * 2. All pending #raft_io_append disk writes across all servers, that have been
 *    submitted using #raft_io->append() but not yet completed, are scanned and
 *    the one with the lowest completion time is picked. All in-flight network
 *    messages waiting to be delivered are scanned and the one with the lowest
 *    delivery time is picked. All servers are scanned, and the one with the
 *    lowest tick expiration time is picked. The three times are compared and
 *    the lowest one is picked. If a #raft_io_append disk write has completed,
 *    the relevant callback will be invoked, if there's a network message to be
 *    delivered, the receiver's @raft_io_recv_cb callback gets fired, if a tick
 *    timer has expired the relevant #raft_io->tick() callback will be
 *    invoked. Only one event will be fired. If there is more than one event to
 *    fire, one of them is picked according to the following rules: events for
 *    servers with lower index are fired first, tick events take precedence over
 *    disk events, and disk events take precedence over network events.
 *
 * 3. The current cluster leader is detected (if any). When detecting the leader
 *    the Election Safety property is checked: no servers can be in leader state
 *    for the same term. The server in leader state with the highest term is
 *    considered the current cluster leader, as long as it's "stable", i.e. it
 *    has been acknowledged by all servers connected to it, and those servers
 *    form a majority (this means that no further leader change can happen,
 *    unless the network gets disrupted). If there is a stable leader and it has
 *    not changed with respect to the previous call to @raft_fixture_step(),
 *    then the Leader Append-Only property is checked, by comparing its log with
 *    a copy of it that was taken during the previous iteration.
 *
 * 4. If there is a stable leader, its current log is copied, in order to be
 *    able to check the Leader Append-Only property at the next call.
 *
 * 5. If there is a stable leader, its commit index gets copied.
 *
 * The function returns information about which particular event occurred
 * (either in step 1 or 2).

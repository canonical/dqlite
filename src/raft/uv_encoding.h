 * The layout of the memory pointed at by a @batch pointer is the following:

 * [8 bytes] Number of entries in the batch, little endian.
 * [header1] Header data of the first entry of the batch.

 * [headerN] Header data of the last entry of the batch.
 * [data1  ] Payload data of the first entry of the batch.
 * [  ...  ] More data
 * [dataN  ] Payload data of the last entry of the batch.
 *
 * An entry header is 16-byte long and has the following layout:
 *
 * [8 bytes] Term in which the entry was created, little endian.
 * [1 byte ] Message type (Either RAFT_COMMAND or RAFT_CHANGE)
 * [3 bytes] Currently unused.
 * [4 bytes] Size of the log entry data, little endian.
 * [8 bytes] Size of the local buffer, little endian.
 *
 * A payload data section for an entry is simply a sequence of bytes of
 * arbitrary lengths, possibly padded with extra bytes to reach 8-byte boundary
 * (which means that all entry data pointers are 8-byte aligned).
